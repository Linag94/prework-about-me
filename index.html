      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Full-stack web developer at Columbia University. Skilled in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, jQuery and responsive web design. By leveraging the tools and experience gained from the bootcamp, I am more equipped to collaborate with back-end developers and web designers to improve any web applicationâ€™s usability. With each project, my goal is to engage the audience by providing a user experience that is both memorable and immersive. My familiarity with browser testing, debugging and an in depth understanding of the entire web development process, warrants success on every project.  Excited to continuously hone my skills and grow, while being a part of a fast-paced quality-driven team.   </p>
